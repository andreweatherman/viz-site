I live in London and post-graduated with an MBA from Hult International Business School as valedictorian in 2001.

I served for 36 years at [Big Blue](https://www.ibm.com/), performing roles combining business (strategy and growth) leadership with data science and machine learning.

My passion for data science and machine learning extends beyond work. The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) make this a real joy to do.

[Adobe Fresco](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/fresco.html) does the same for my little digital artworks {{< iconify material-symbols palette-outline >}} to bring it all to life.

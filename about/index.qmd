<div>

I live in Durham, North Carolina, and graduated from Duke University with a degree in public policy in 2023.

At Duke, I was a student manager for the men's basketball team under head coaches Mike Krzyzewski and Jon Scheyer.

I work in `R` for a living, but my passions extend far beyond the office. I am an active contributor to the open-source community, authoring both the `cbbdata` and `cbbplotR` packages.

I am a firm believer in democratizing code and data. I hope that this site and its contents provide inspiration and learning.

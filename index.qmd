### Hi there

Well, my *main* website is still [here](https://www.aweatherman.com/), but I hope to port most things over to this site in the future.

My name is **Andrew Weatherman**, and I'm an R programmer and data enthusiast. I created this Quarto landing page as a place to open-source some of my visualization code.

This is still **very much a work-in-progress**, and I have [several plans for this site](https://x.com/andreweatherman/status/1788717391351796146) that I hope to get to in the future -- but for now, you can check out [some code](viz/index.qmd) and some of [my favorite music](spotify/index.qmd).

If you want to connect, the best place is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andreweatherman). I'm not active on LinkedIn (I don't understand it), and I'm probably more responsive on the bird app vs. email.

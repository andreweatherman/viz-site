Following the launch of a new [open-source scientific and technical publishing system](https://quarto.org), it's time to get the paint brush out again.\n\nI initially started to convert some of my projects and posts from `Rmarkdown` to `qmd` using `format: hugo-md`. The thought was to keep my existing site aesthetic, with its beautiful Hugo Ap√©ro theme, unchanged. I found though that it wasn't possible to make full use of the myriad features offered by Quarto. For example `code-link: true` and `date-modified: last-modified`. This is because the document metadata is preserved as-is for formats like Hugo.\n\nSo, I decided to start building a \"full-on Quarto\" version, i.e. `format: html`, with the intent of switching the website over only if I preferred the new versus the old when running the two side-by-side.\n\nI've switched over.\n\nI've given the site a unique look-and-feel by customising the `flatly` and `darkly` themes with a number of SASS variables in two `theme.scss` files, for example, to adopt my own reversible colour scheme.\n\nThe landing page switches image based on the dark-mode setting by making the class of the first image `.dark-mode` and adding these two lines in the dark theme's custom scss file:\n\n``` scss\n.dark-mode { display: block; }\n.light-mode { display: none; }\n```\n\nThen the second image has the class `.light-mode` and uses the mirror css code in the light theme's custom scss file:\n\n``` scss\n.light-mode { display: block; }\n.dark-mode { display: none; }\n```\n\nThe mid-grey logo on the left-side of the navbar also darkens and lightens based on the dark-mode setting by adjusting the brightness based on the mode:\n\n``` scss\n.navbar-logo {\n    filter: brightness(2);\n    max-height: 30px;\n}\n\n.navbar-logo {\n    filter: brightness(20%);\n    max-height: 30px;\n}\n```\n\nAs for all the other features, not only does the site now have the `code-link`, `date-modified`, and dark-mode, but it also restores the grid-based listing pages given up when moving from Hugo Academic. Many other Quarto features such as call-outs, citations, footnotes and freeze are also now deployed.\n\nWhilst refreshing the site, I took the opportunity to make my 404 page a little more welcoming as it seemed to be one of my more popular pages. Feel free to try it by visiting an imaginatively made-up page of your choice.\n\nThe updated [repo](https://github.com/cgoo4/quantumjitter) is public on github.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![v 1.3.24](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",

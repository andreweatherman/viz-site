He [open-sourced his code on GitHub](https://github.com/cobrastats/2024-CFB-Football-Calendar), and with his permission, I created a pull request to show my attempt at creating the same graphic. You can find that code, with brief explanation, on the repository linked above, but I'm going to use this space to expand a bit more.\n\n\n{{< tweet cobrastats 1784266700147318817 >}}\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>What we will be creating</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](schedule.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n# The How\n\nFor this table, we will need:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(gtExtras)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(cbbdata)\nlibrary(rlang)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Data\n\nMost of this is pretty straightforward. With `schedule`, we pull the 2024 college football schedule, filter for games that have occured (NY6), select the relevant variables, and then convert the `date` column.\n\nWith `weeks`, we pull the week numbers associated with each range of dates in the 2024 season -- since not all games in a given week are played on the same day.\n\nFinally, we use the [overlap join](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/01/dplyr-1-1-0-joins/#rolling-joins) functionality in the `dplyr::X_join` family to match our game dates to week numbers *between* the `start_date` and `end_date` range in `weeks`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe don't actually *need* to grab `weeks` (or join our data) because we *could* just infer the week numbers from game dates (ascending order) -- but I did so for clarity and practice.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nschedule <- espn_cfb_schedule(year = 2024, limit = 1000) %>% \n  filter(is.na(home_record)) %>% # remove games that have occured\n  select(home_team = home_team_location, away_team = away_team_location, date = game_date) %>% \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ\"))\n\nweeks <- espn_cfb_calendar(year = 2024) %>% \n  select(week, start_date, end_date) %>% \n  mutate(across(-week, ~as.Date(.x, format = \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ\")))\n\nschedule <- left_join(\n  schedule,\n  weeks,\n  join_by(between(date, start_date, end_date))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's create a vector of Big Ten teams and filter down.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nb1g = c(\"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Nebraska\", \"Northwestern\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Minnesota\",\n        \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Rutgers\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Purdue\", \"Maryland\", \"Washington\", \"USC\", \"UCLA\", \"Oregon\")\n\nschedule <- schedule %>% filter(home_team %in% b1g | away_team %in% b1g)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Pivoting data with help from `nflreadr`\n\nRight now, our data looks like this. For plotting, however, we want 18 rows (number of Big Ten teams) and 15 columns (one for Big Ten teams and 14 others for week). There are a few ways to approach this problem, and the easiest is to simply \"pivot\" our data wider.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|home_team |away_team             |date       | week|start_date |end_date   |\n|:---------|:---------------------|:----------|----:|:----------|:----------|\n|Minnesota |North Carolina        |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n|Illinois  |Eastern Illinois      |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n|Indiana   |Florida International |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n|Iowa      |Illinois State        |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n|Maryland  |UConn                 |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n|Michigan  |Fresno State          |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith pivoting, though, we're going to run in a small problem: Our Big Ten team might be home *or* away. The two columns with team information are organized by location and not conference. We can fix this by first pivoting our data to a long format, using `pivot_longer`, and then filter the resulting `value` column for Big Ten teams.\n\nFor this case, `pivot_longer` works, but other times, you might have more statistics and want a more streamlined solution. I want to show off a nice utility function from `nflreadr` that will pivot data and convert your pipeline to something more standardized: `nflreadr::clean_homeaway`. It converts `home_` and `away_` prefixed columns to `team_` and `opponent_` while doubling the rows (one row per team, not per game).\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you relabel `home_team` and `away_team` to `home` and `away`, then `schedule %>% pivot_longer(home:away)` would accomplish the exact same thing. I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce this function.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nschedule %>% \n  select(home_team, away_team, week) %>% \n  clean_homeaway()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|team                  |opponent              |date       | week|start_date |end_date   |location |\n|:---------------------|:---------------------|:----------|----:|:----------|:----------|:--------|\n|Minnesota             |North Carolina        |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|North Carolina        |Minnesota             |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n|Illinois              |Eastern Illinois      |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|Eastern Illinois      |Illinois              |2024-08-29 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n|Indiana               |Florida International |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|Florida International |Indiana               |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n|Iowa                  |Illinois State        |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|Illinois State        |Iowa                  |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n|Maryland              |UConn                 |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|UConn                 |Maryland              |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n|Michigan              |Fresno State          |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |home     |\n|Fresno State          |Michigan              |2024-08-31 |    1|2024-08-24 |2024-09-03 |away     |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter which, we can filter down to Big Ten teams.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- schedule %>% \n  select(home_team, away_team, week) %>% \n  nflreadr::clean_homeaway() %>% \n  filter(team %in% b1g)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Adding logos\n\nBefore we can pivot our data, we need to add team logos *and* find a way to preserve our `location` data during the pivot without creating new columns. A nifty idea is to transition our `opponent` column to an HTML string with an `<img>` tag that includes the link to the team logo *and* uses the `alt` caption to encode `location` data. In a static table, the `alt` tag serves no purpose, *so* we can use `glue` to toss in the game location.\n\nFirst, let's grab team logos. Importantly, these team names are coming from ESPN, so let's select those values to ensure an effortless join. We are going to use `pull` and `set_names` to create a *named vector* with team names and logo links.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlogos <- cbd_teams() %>% select(team = espn_location, logo)\nlogos <- logos %>% pull(logo) %>% set_names(logos$team)\n```\n:::\n\n\nRemember that named vectors work like so, `object_name[value]`, so to grab logo links for our opponent column, we can do: `logos[opponent]`. Our location data is stored inside of the `alt` tag shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- plot_data %>% \n  mutate(opponent = glue(\"<img src='{logos[opponent]}' alt={location} style='height:25px; vertical-align:middle;'>\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have converted our `opponent` column, we can safely pivot our data wider by selecting `team` as the identifier column, grabbing our column names from the week variable, and setting our values as the `opponent` column.\n\nFinally, we will arrange our data in alphabetical order by team and *then* convert our `team` column to the proper logo link using the named vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- plot_data %>% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = team, names_from = week, values_from = opponent) %>% \n  arrange(team) %>% \n  mutate(team = logos[team])\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Plotting\n\n### Conditional Highlighting\n\nIn our table, we are going to highlight on two conditions: a) game location (home games are blue; away games are white) and b) bye weeks (gray).\n\nBut the problem is that conditional highlighting in `gt` is a bit weird because `tab_style` + `cell_fill` does not really work as one might expect. Namely, row and column vectors aren't treated as separate pairs. If you pass through, e.g. rows = c(1, 2) and columns = c(5, 6) inside `tab_style`, you'll fill four cells, not two, because `tab_style` doesn't treat things as unique pairs.\n\nTurns out, you can just build the CSS string for highlighting cells outside of the table and apply it directly with `opt_css`. The basic idea is this: We take a matrix of row-column indices, a table ID, and a color -- and then inject those into a basic CSS string that targets cells and colors their background.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenerate_css <- function(indices, css_id, color) {\n    map2_chr(\n    .x = indices[, 1],\n    .y = indices[, 2],\n    .f = ~glue(\"#{css_id} tbody tr:nth-child({.x}) td:nth-child({.y}) {{ background-color: {color}; }}\")\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are using `which` and `str_detect` to find the row and column indices where \"home\" is present inside the `alt` tag -- the same with `is.na` for bye games -- and then apply our `generate_css` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhome_css <- arrayInd(which(str_detect(as.matrix(plot_data), 'alt=home')), .dim = dim(plot_data)) %>% \n  generate_css('table', '#cce7f5')\n\nbye_css <- arrayInd(which(is.na(as.matrix(plot_data))), .dim = dim(plot_data)) %>% \n  generate_css('table', '#d9d9d9')\n```\n:::\n\n\nI'm going to add one more pieces of css, and to make things cleaner in the final plot code, I'm going to define that rule here. (This just decreases the spacing in my caption.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadditional_css <- \"\n  \n  #table .gt_sourcenote {\n    line-height: 1.3;\n  }\n\n\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Header + Legend\n\nI like how the original table combines the legend with the title, and I'm going to do the same. I'm going to make two changes: a) I'm not using the Big Ten logo and b) I'm going to stack the title and legend (and center it).\n\nThis is all done with custom HTML, which will further inherit certain styles from the table theme (font family, size, weight, etc.). We can tweak a bit of that with in-line CSS.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhtml_content <- '\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <h1 style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 20px;\">Big Ten Football Schedule | 2024</h1>\n  <div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 5px;\">\n    <div style=\"border: 1.5px solid black; padding: 2px 10px; text-align: center; background-color: #cce7f5; font-size: 10px; margin-right: 5px;\">Home</div>\n    <div style=\"border: 1.5px solid black; padding: 2px 10px; text-align: center; font-size: 10px; margin-right: 5px;\">Away</div>\n    <div style=\"border: 1.5px solid black; padding: 2px 10px; text-align: center; background-color: #d9d9d9; font-size: 10px;\">Bye</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n'\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Building the table\n\nThe body of our table is pretty straightforward. `fmt_image` renders in our logo link for the `team` column, while `fmt_markdown` does the same thing for weeks 1:14. `sub_missing` is a great utility function to replace text in `NA` columns. We can use `gt_add_divider` to create more pronounced divisions between rows and weeks (I prefer this look over the original).\n\n::: callout-tip\nSince we built an HTML string for our opponent columns, to preserve the game location data, we need to use `fmt_markdown`, not `fmt_image`.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data %>% \n  gt(id = 'table') %>% \n  gt_theme_538() %>% \n  fmt_image(team, height = 25) %>%\n  fmt_markdown(-team) %>% \n  # use sub_missing to replace na with empty text string\n  sub_missing(-team, missing_text = '') %>% \n  cols_align(columns = everything(), 'center') %>% \n  cols_label(team = '') %>% \n  # bold col. headers\n  tab_style(locations = cells_column_labels(), style = cell_text(weight = 'bold')) %>% \n  # add dividers\n  gt_add_divider(columns = -team, sides = 'all', include_labels = FALSE, color = 'black', weight = px(1.5)) %>% \n  tab_header(html(html_content)) %>% \n  tab_source_note(md(\"Data by cfbfastR<br>Viz. by @andreweatherman (h/t to @cobrastats)\")) %>% \n  tab_options(data_row.padding = 1) %>% \n  # apply above css\n  opt_css(c(home_css, bye_css, additional_css)) %>% \n  gtsave_extra(\"schedule.png\", zoom = 5)\n```\n:::\n",

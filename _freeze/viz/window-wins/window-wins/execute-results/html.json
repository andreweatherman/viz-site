You can adapt this code to, instead, look at win percentage, losses, etc., at the national or conference level.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>What we will be creating</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](wins_since_1980.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</detials>\n\n# The How\n\nFor this table, we will need:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(gtExtras)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(xml2)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(cbbdata)\nlibrary(cbbplotR)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Data\n\n### Grab The Data\n\nWe need to grab per-season win totals from 1980 to 2024. There are a few ways to pull this data, but to keep things open and free, we will scrape individual season pages on Sports Reference and not use a paid source like Stathead.\n\nWe can grab season record by-year with `rvest` by iterating through `https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/men/{YEAR}-ratings.html`. The data is stored in static tables, so a simple `html_table` function should do the trick here.\n\nUsing the [SelectorGadget tool](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/selectorgadget.html), we can find the tag associated with the standings table on every page.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Selector Gadget</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](selector-gadget.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\nUsing a simple loop, we can grab per-season conference wins and losses. Here, we hit the ratings page, scrape the static table, \"lift\" it from the resulting list, and do some basic data manipulation.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## `janitor` functions when scraping\n\nIf you're relatively new to web scraping in R, take note of the `row_to_names` and `clean_names` functions (both from the `janitor` package). If the column names of your data are stored in some row in the returned frame, `row_to_names` will elevate that row to be the column names. You'll routinely find that your column headers are stored in the first or second row when scraping Sports Reference.\n\n`clean_names` \"standardizes\" your column names, which is sometimes just a nice touch and other times a necessity. Actually, if you *remove* that line from the function below, you'll run into an error because the resulting tibble has a few columns with empty names. You won't be able to do any `mutate` or `filter`. It's recommended to run `clean_names` after `row_to_names`. (It's my opinion that `row_to_names` should have an optional argument to do this without needing a separate call.)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason_results <- map_dfr(1980:2024, \\(year) {\n  Sys.sleep(3) # for 501 error\n\n  suppressWarnings({\n    read_html(glue(\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/men/{year}-ratings.html\")) %>%\n      html_nodes(\"#ratings\") %>% # target standings\n      html_table() %>% # get table\n      pluck(1) %>% # pluck from list\n      row_to_names(1) %>% # first row are col. names\n      clean_names() %>%\n      mutate(year = year,\n             across(w:l, as.numeric)) %>% # convert w and l to numeric\n      filter(!is.na(w)) %>% # remove non-team rows\n      select(team = school, wins = w, losses = l, year)\n  })\n  \n}, .progress = 'Getting data')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis code will take around two to three minutes to run. Alternatively, you can download a copy of the data below.\n\n\n{{< downloadthis data/season_results.csv dname=\"season_results_sr\" label=\"Download a copy of season_results\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\n\n\n### Calculate the Windows\n\nThere are a few ways to apply a function, i.e. summing things, over a rolling window. [`zoo::rollapply`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/zoo/versions/1.8-12/topics/rollapply) is a nice method, and the [`slider` package](https://github.com/r-lib/slider) provides some useful functionality.\n\n*But*, I'm going to do it a bit differently and write a function to loop over. I'm doing this because it's, in my opinion, the most intuitive and accessible approach. All I'm using is basic `dplyr` functions.\n\nThis function takes a data frame and a starting year. It then filters between that starting year and nine years into the future, using `between`, to grab 10-year \"windows.\" For each team, denoted with `.by` inside `summarize`, it calculates total wins, total losses, and win percentage (we only *need* total wins, but I decided to grab more data in case you want to plot something else).\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Easier grouping with `.by` in `dplyr`\n\n`dplyr` v1.1.0 brought per-operation grouping with `.by`/`by`. This released in early 2023, but for some reason, I still see a lot of people unnecessarily using `group_by`.\n\nIn several `dplyr` functions, including `summarize`, `mutate`, and `filter`, you can specify a grouping level that is *only* active within *that* verb -- meaning there is no need to use `group_by` + `ungroup`!\n\nThere are some nuances to this, and you can [read more about them here.](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-per-operation-grouping/)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate_windows <- function(start_year, data) {\n  data %>%\n    filter(between(year, start_year, start_year + 9)) %>% \n    summarize(\n      total_wins = sum(wins),\n      total_losses = sum(losses),\n      win_percentage = total_wins / (total_wins + total_losses),\n      seasons = n(),\n      .by = team\n    ) %>%\n    mutate(years = paste(start_year, start_year + 9, sep=\"-\"),\n           begin = start_year,\n           end = start_year + 9)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can, again, use `purrr` to iterate over our function. We want to loop over the beginning of our sequence (1980) to the last observed year **minus** nine (`2024 - 9` = `2015`). This ensures that we capture the final *complete* window.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason_windows <- map_dfr(1980:2015, ~calculate_windows(.x, season_results))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, let's choose the five winningest teams over each window. We are breaking ties by highest win percentage, so we need to specify `desc(win_percentage)` as our *second* argument inside `arrange` and then take the first five rows in each window.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- season_windows %>% \n  group_by(years) %>% # arrange does not support per-operation grouping\n  arrange(desc(total_wins), desc(win_percentage), .by_group = TRUE) %>% # ignores grouping by default\n  slice_head(n = 5) %>% \n  mutate(position = row_number()) %>% # need position value for plotting\n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|team             | total_wins| total_losses| win_percentage| seasons|years     | begin|  end| position|\n|:----------------|----------:|------------:|--------------:|-------:|:---------|-----:|----:|--------:|\n|North Carolina   |        281|           63|      0.8168605|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        1|\n|Nevada-Las Vegas |        271|           65|      0.8065476|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        2|\n|Georgetown       |        269|           69|      0.7958580|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        3|\n|Louisville       |        250|           96|      0.7225434|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        4|\n|Oklahoma         |        245|           90|      0.7313433|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        5|\n|Nevada-Las Vegas |        283|           61|      0.8226744|      10|1981-1990 |  1981| 1990|        1|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### National titles\n\nBelow, we're going to talk about how to fill `gt` cells based on some condition, and that will require us to pull national championship winners. For consistency, since this section is about \"data,\" I'll just include that code here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchamps <- read_html('https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/') %>% \n  html_nodes(\"#seasons_NCAAM\") %>% \n  html_table() %>% \n  pluck(1) %>% \n  clean_names() %>% \n  mutate(year = parse_number(tournament)) %>% \n  select(year, team = ncaa_champion) %>% \n  filter(year >= 1954 & year != 2020)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are going to adapt the `calculate_windows` function from above to do the same thing with number of championships.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate_titles <- function(start_year, data) {\n  data %>%\n    filter(between(year, start_year, start_year + 9)) %>% \n    summarize(\n      total_titles = n(),\n      .by = team\n    ) %>%\n    mutate(years = paste(start_year, start_year + 9, sep=\"-\"),\n           begin = start_year,\n           end = start_year + 9)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's apply that in a similar fashion to `calculate_windows`. We're also going to change the numeric counts of `total_titles` to a general categorical variable to assist in plotting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchamps <- map_dfr(1980:2024, ~calculate_titles(.x, champs)) %>% \n  mutate(total_titles = ifelse(total_titles == 1, '1', '2+')) %>% \n  select(team, total_titles, years)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's join that information over to `plot_data`. Teams that are *not* present inside `champs` will show as `NA`. We will fill these with 0s.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- plot_data %>% \n  left_join(champs, by = c('team', 'years')) %>% \n  mutate(total_titles = replace_na(total_titles, '0'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|team             | total_wins| total_losses| win_percentage| seasons|years     | begin|  end| position|total_titles |\n|:----------------|----------:|------------:|--------------:|-------:|:---------|-----:|----:|--------:|:------------|\n|North Carolina   |        281|           63|      0.8168605|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        1|1            |\n|Nevada-Las Vegas |        271|           65|      0.8065476|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        2|0            |\n|Georgetown       |        269|           69|      0.7958580|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        3|1            |\n|Louisville       |        250|           96|      0.7225434|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        4|2+           |\n|Oklahoma         |        245|           90|      0.7313433|      10|1980-1989 |  1980| 1989|        5|0            |\n|Nevada-Las Vegas |        283|           61|      0.8226744|      10|1981-1990 |  1981| 1990|        1|1            |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Getting Ready for Plotting\n\nEverything before this point has been pretty straightforward. But uh, now it's time to start the \"hacking\" that I promised at the start.\n\n### Conditional highlighting\n\n#### Team Logos + Pivoting\n\nIn our table, we are going to highlight on three conditions: a) no national titles won inside the window, b) one national title won inside the window, and c) multiple national titles won inside the window. (We aren't actually going to do anything with point A; we'll just leave those cells as-is -- \"filled with white\").\n\nBut the problem is that conditional highlighting in `gt` is a bit weird because `tab_style` + `cell_fill` does not *really* work as one might expect. Namely, row and column vectors aren't treated as separate pairs. If you pass through, e.g. `rows = c(1, 2)` and `columns = c(5, 6)` inside `tab_style`, you'll fill *four* cells, not two, because `tab_style` doesn't treat things as unique pairs.\n\nTurns out, you can just build the CSS string for highlighting cells *outside* of the table and apply it directly with `opt_css`...but this is a bit convoluted when you are highlighting multiple things.\n\nOkay, so how do we do that? First, let's grab team logos by creating a [named vector](https://rpubs.com/sowmya21jan/338762) using `cbd_logos` from `cbbdata`. (`cbbdata` ships with a function to create a named vector for matching team names, and I'll eventually do the same thing for logos.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlogos <- cbd_teams() %>% select(team = sr_team, logo)\nlogos <- logos %>% pull(logo) %>% rlang::set_names(logos$team)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOkay, so we're going to need to pivot our data, but if we do it now, things *will* work...but our resulting tibble loses a crucial piece of information: `total_titles`!\n\nI thought of a nifty way to include that information without sacrificing the neatness of our pivoted table. We can create an HTML string using `<img>` tags to reference logo links and throw in an `alt` tag that refers to `total_titles`. Adding an `alt` tag is completely harmless in our static table.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Pivoting in `R`\n\nI'm not going to lie, pivoting was one of the few things that *really* took some time to \"click.\" I recommend looking over [this vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html) if you're in the same boat.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_data <- plot_data %>% \n  mutate(team = glue(\"<img src='{logos[team]}' alt={total_titles} style='height:30px; vertical-align:middle;'>\")) %>% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = years, names_from = position, values_from = team)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Generating the CSS\n\nThe final part is to define a function that will generate our needed CSS. Our CSS needs to target an individual cell and set its `background-color` relative to the number of titles won in a window, which is included in our `alt` tag. We can use the base R functions `arrayInd` and `which` to return a matrix of row-column indices that point to where the specific `alt` tag is true.\n\nWe will then loop over these indices to generate a string in the structure of `#table_id tbody tr:nth-child({row}) td:nth-child({column}) {{ background-color: {color}; }}`.\n\nThis looping is done when generating the tables themselves, but the functions are defined below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenerate_css <- function(data, css_id, pattern, color) {\n  indices <- arrayInd(\n    which(str_detect(as.matrix(data), pattern)),\n    .dim = dim(data)\n  )\n  map2_chr(\n    .x = indices[, 1],\n    .y = indices[, 2],\n    .f = ~glue(\"#{css_id} tbody tr:nth-child({.x}) td:nth-child({.y}) {{ background-color: {color}; }}\")\n  )\n  \n}\n\npatterns_colors <- tibble(\n  pattern = c('alt=0', 'alt=1', 'alt=2+'),\n  color = c('#ffffff', '#ECCE83', '#F4A261')\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAn example of the CSS rule for targeting specific instances with no national title:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"#table tbody tr:nth-child(10) td:nth-child(2) { background-color: #ffffff; }\"\n[2] \"#table tbody tr:nth-child(11) td:nth-child(2) { background-color: #ffffff; }\"\n[3] \"#table tbody tr:nth-child(30) td:nth-child(2) { background-color: #ffffff; }\"\n[4] \"#table tbody tr:nth-child(32) td:nth-child(2) { background-color: #ffffff; }\"\n[5] \"#table tbody tr:nth-child(33) td:nth-child(2) { background-color: #ffffff; }\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Header + Legend\n\nI went back and forth on how to style the table header. I thought about effectively removing the need for a legend by coloring specific text in the subtitle with the appropriate colors -- ala [1 national title in window]{style=\"color: #ECCE83;font-weight:bold;\"} and [2+ titles in window]{style=\"color: #F4A261;font-weight:bold;\"} -- but I wanted to keep with the colored boxes theme of the body itself.\n\nIf you haven't caught on by now, `gt` offers *so much* versatility because it effectively renders HTML, and you can do *a lot* of stuff with that. To build the legend boxes, we can create a `span` that uses `inline-block` with equal width and height (to make squares). We then \"mush\" everything together in a single `<div>`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkey_info <- tibble(\n  color = c('#ECCE83', '#F4A261'),\n  label = c(\"1 national title in window\", '2+ titles in window')\n)\n\nkey_html <- key_info %>%\n  mutate(\n    key_item = glue(\"<span style='display: inline-block; margin-right: 5px; width: 15px; height: 15px; background-color: {color};'></span><span style='margin-left: 5px;font-size:12px;vertical-align:20%'>{label}</span>\")\n  ) %>%\n  pull(key_item) %>%\n  paste(collapse = ' ')\n\nfull_header_html <- glue(\n  \"<div style='text-align: center;'>\n    <div style='font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 4px;'>Winningest college basketball programs in 10-year windows</div>\n    <div style='font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 10px;font-weight:normal'>Ties are broken by win percentage. Data starts from 0 in 1980.</div>\n    <div>{key_html}</div>\n  </div>\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Plotting\n\n### Building the table\n\nThe table itself is actually pretty simple. There isn't much `gt` going here. Because we are building a two-column layout, we should define a function to build our table.\n\nIt's important that we are slicing the right data for each \"side\" of the table, and the `split` line does exactly that. Next, we loop over the `generate_css` function that we created earlier, and we push the output into a single string with `unlist` and `paste`.\n\nFinally, we build the table. Again, not too much going on here. The `gt_theme_athletic` function from `cbbplotR` does a lot of the styling for us. We use `fmt_markdown` to render our HTML strings, adjust the column headers, add column spanners, and render our title. Importantly, we need to add a placeholder for our table caption -- more on that later. We add the conditional highlighting CSS with `opt_css`. We then loop over this table function to create a list of tables.\n\n::: callout-warning\nFor two-column layouts with independent CSS rules, it's vital that we define a table ID *and* pass that to our `generate_css` function. If you don't do that, and summarily remove `{#css_id}` from the `glue` statement in the function itself, only one set of CSS rules will apply to both tables.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbuild_table <- function(data, split_level, css_id) {\n  \n  split <- if(split_level == 1) data %>% slice(1:(nrow(.) / 2)) else data %>% slice(floor(nrow(.) / 2) + 1:nrow(.))\n  \n  # map over patterns and colors to generate CSS\n  css_rules <- map2(\n    patterns_colors$pattern,\n    patterns_colors$color,\n    ~generate_css(split, css_id, .x, .y)\n  )\n\n  # combine all CSS rules into one string\n  combined_css <- css_rules %>% unlist() %>% paste(collapse = \"\\n\")\n    \n  table <- split %>% \n    gt(id = css_id) %>% \n    gt_theme_athletic() %>% \n    fmt_markdown(-years) %>% \n    tab_style(locations = cells_column_labels(), style = cell_text(weight = 'bold', size = px(13))) %>% \n    tab_style(locations = cells_title(\"title\"), style = cell_text(size = px(20))) %>%\n    tab_spanner(columns = -years, label = \"Best Win% in Window\") %>% \n    tab_header(html(full_header_html)) %>% \n    tab_source_note(\"placeholder\") %>% \n    opt_css(combined_css)\n  \n  return(table)\n  \n}\n\n# loop over to create two tables\ntables <- list(build_table(plot_data, 1, 'first'), build_table(plot_data, 2, 'second'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Putting the tables together\n\n`gtExtras` ships with a convenient function to create a two-column layout, `gt_two_column_layout`, but this doesn't work well with our HTML title -- so we can't use that. Doing some digging, I was able to recreate that effect in a way that works for us.\n\nFirst, let's handle another issue that arises when using `gt_two_column_layout`: table captions (source notes). The latter uses an unexported function from `gtExtras` to extract a table title + subtitle, its class, and its style to then pass through to `htmltools` when rendering the table.\n\nI took that function and reworked it to do the same thing for source notes. Remember that placeholder caption? Well, the reason we included one was to access its styles.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nextract_source_note <- function(table) {\n  raw_html <- as_raw_html(table) %>%\n    read_html()\n  \n  gt_source_note <- raw_html %>%\n    xml_find_first(\"//*[contains(concat(' ',normalize-space(@class),' '),' gt_sourcenote ')]\")\n  \n  gt_table_id <- raw_html %>%\n    xml_find_all(\"//body/div\") %>%\n    xml_attr(\"id\")\n  \n  s <- raw_html %>%\n    xml_find_first(\"//style\") %>%\n    xml_contents() %>%\n    xml_text() %>%\n    gsub(gt_table_id, \"mycombinedtable\", x = .) %>%\n    gsub(\"mycombinedtable table\", \"mycombinedtable div\", x = .)\n  \n  list(\n    source_note = gtExtras:::xml_missing(gt_source_note),\n    source_note_class = paste(\"gt_table\", xml_attr(gt_source_note, \"class\")),\n    source_note_style = xml_attr(gt_source_note, \"style\"),\n    style = s\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's apply the `gtExtras` function and the one above to extract our annotations (title, subtitle, and caption). Since both tables' information is analogous, we only need to apply these functions to one table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheader_data <- gtExtras:::extract_tab_header_and_style(tables[[1]])\ncaption_data <- extract_source_note(tables[[1]])\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we can use the `htmltools` package to generate an HTML container (`div`) that includes our tables and annotations! You can think of this as building the output vertically, where the title + subtitle go first, then the tables, and then our caption.\n\nFor the tables, we need to remove the individual annotations. Conveniently, you can set `tab_header(NULL, NULL)` to remove the title and subtitle, but for the caption, just setting `tab_source_note(NULL)` won't actually work. You need to use the `rm_source_notes` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndouble_tables <- htmltools::div(\n  id = \"mycombinedtable\", # need this exact ID\n  ## table\n  htmltools::tag(\"style\", header_data[[\"style\"]]),\n  htmltools::div(\n    htmltools::HTML(full_header_html),  # Your custom header HTML\n    class = header_data[[\"title_class\"]],\n    style = header_data[[\"title_style\"]]\n  ),\n  htmltools::div(tables[[1]] %>% gt::tab_header(NULL, NULL) %>% rm_source_notes(), style = \"display: inline-block;float:left;\"),\n  htmltools::div(tables[[2]] %>% gt::tab_header(NULL, NULL) %>% rm_source_notes(), style = \"display: inline-block;float:right;\"),\n  ## caption\n  htmltools::tag(\"style\", caption_data[[\"style\"]]),\n  htmltools::div(\n    \"Data by Sports Reference | Viz. + Analysis by @andreweatherman | Idea from @JFreshHockey\",  # Your custom header HTML\n    class = caption_data[[\"source_note_class\"]],\n    style = caption_data[[\"source_note_style\"]]\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo view the output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhtmltools::browsable(double_tables)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo save the output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngtsave_extra(double_tables, \"wins_since_1980.png\", vwidth = 595, vheight = 1500, zoom = 5)\n```\n:::\n",

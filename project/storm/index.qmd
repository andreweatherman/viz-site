In 2020, Covid-19 began battering financial markets now further impacted by the war in Ukraine. Which sectors are faring best?

I'll compare each sector in the S&P 500 with the overall market. Baselining each at zero as of February 19th, we'll see which were the first to recover lost ground.

library(conflicted)
library(tidyverse)
conflict_prefer_all("dplyr")
library(wesanderson)
library(scales)
library(glue)

```{r}

#| dev.args: { bg: "transparent" }

theme_set(theme_bw())

(cols <- wes_palette("Moonrise2"))
```

```{r}
#| label: symbols

symbols <-
  c(
    "SPY",
    "XLV",
    "XLK",
    "XLE",
    "XLF",
    "XLC",
    "XLI",
    "XLY",
    "XLP",
    "XLRE",
    "XLU",
    "XLB"
  )

from <- "2020-02-19"

from_formatted <- date_parse(from, format = "%Y-%m-%d") |> 
  date_format(format = "%b %d, %Y")
```

```{r}
#| label: sectors

eod_sectors <-
  tq_get(symbols, from = from) |>
  mutate(
    norm_close = adjusted / first(adjusted) - 1,
    type = if_else(symbol == "SPY", "Market", "Sector"),
    sector = case_match(
      symbol,
      "SPY"  ~ "S&P 500",
      "XLB"  ~ "Materials",
      "XLE"  ~ "Energy",
      "XLU"  ~ "Utilities",
      "XLI"  ~ "Industrical",
      "XLRE" ~ "Real Estate",
      "XLV"  ~ "Health",
      "XLK"  ~ "Technology",
      "XLF"  ~ "Financial",
      "XLC"  ~ "Communication",
      "XLY"  ~ "Consumer Discretionary",
      "XLP"  ~ "Consumer Staples",
      .default = "Other"
    ), .by = symbol
  ) |>
  drop_na()
```

Perhaps not too surprising to see that Tech led the way back from Covid. But with the further impact of the situation in Ukraine, the Energy sector is now the strongest performer relative to February 2020. Comms, with all that home-working, benefited initially during the lockdown, but has faded since.

```{r}
#| label: visualisation

eod_sectors |>
  mutate(
    sector = str_wrap(sector, 12),
    sector = fct_reorder(sector, norm_close, last, .desc = TRUE)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(date, norm_close, colour = sign(norm_close))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", colour = "grey80") +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~sector) +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = cols[2], high = cols[1]) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  labs(
    title = "S&P 500 Sector Impact of Covid-19 & Ukraine",
    subtitle = glue("Relative to {from_formatted}"),
    x = NULL, y = NULL, colour = NULL
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")
```

Summarising below the packages and functions used in this post enables me to separately create a [toolbox visualisation](/project/box) summarising the usage of packages and functions across all posts.

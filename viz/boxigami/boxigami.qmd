# The What

In late December 2023, Todd Whitehead tweeted a visualization that gave a creative spin on career distributions. I'm really digging the 2048-vibe and the ‘Scorigami’ potential.

When I first wrote this code, I did it with Zach Edey and used `cbbdata`, and while I think that package is pretty intuitive, it has a glaring limitation: It only provides men's college basketball data. As such, this code is going to scrape Sports Reference, which will open the door for using women's college basketball data *and* professional data.

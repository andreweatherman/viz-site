# Plot

In early February 2024, Todd Whitehead tweeted a visualization that illustrated points scored in the NBA by former Duke and North Carolina players.

{{< tweet CrumpledJumper 1753900914824659035 >}}

This code, not yet accompanied by a tutorial, works to recreate that visualization using `ggplot2` and data from Sports Reference for Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas, and UCLA players (the primary "Blue Bloods" of college basketball).

The only clue is the cryptic message "404" scrawled on the wall. What could this devilish code mean?

Has there been fiendish foul play; the page spirited away in the dead of night? Or perhaps it was a figment of the imagination encouraged by a little too much cheese before bedtime?

The game's afoot! The services of the master-sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes, and his side-kick Dr Watson have been retained. The bloodhounds are straining at the leash. And a redirect may yet be deduced.

In the meantime please try Sherlock's magnifying glass {{< fa magnifying-glass >}} top-right.
